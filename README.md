Pibble Cleaning Simulator (Pygame)

A small Pygame project featuring Pibble, a popular internet dog meme who likes having their belly washed:3 When the mouse cursor hovers over Pibble, the sprite gradually changes from a dirty Pibble to a clean Pibble.

Features:

Five-frame sprite animation of Pibble getting cleaner

Mouse-based collision detection

Sprite updates after hovering for a set time

PNG images ~~with transparency~~

Centered sprite on screen

The sprite starts centered on the screen.

When the mouse hovers over Pibble, a timer increases.

Every few frames, the sprite updates to the next cleaner version.

Moving the mouse away resets the timer.

Place the images in the project folder:
