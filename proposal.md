# Pibble Survival
## Survival Game with a dog (Pibble) trying to be full of joy and whimsy
> Pibble is a cute internet term for chubby baby dogs
> particularly baby french bull dogs

**Description**
Interactive game played with only mouse. The goal is simply to entertain and I like games
where I can be lazy and only use a mouse. 
> Another one I like is OSRS.


### Game Idea/ Features
In order for pibble to be full of joy and whimsy they must be:
+ clean
  - Wash pibbles belly as it slowly becomes dirtier from the outdoors, the dirtier pibble is the slower joy fills up and eventually it slowly detracts from joy
  - Use mouse to select cleaning supplies like a hose, bar of soap, and sponge
  - Drag cleaning supplies over pibble and move mouse back and forth to begin using the supplies
* full of food
    - Pibble must be kept fed by picking berries from bushes nearby and dragging them from an inventory
    - Bushes will be in the background behind Pibble and slowly grow until ripe and ready to pick
    - When bushes with berries are clicked they are added to an inventory where it can then be dragged to feed pibble
+ well rested
  - Pibble needs to take comfy naps if they are cold place a blanket! if it is raining bring them shelter (doghouse)
  - A blanket will be in the inventory and so will a doghouse for dragging over pibble
  - Pibble will have a sleep bar that once it runs out of energy they go to sleep and must be taken care of while it recharges to full
+ safe from gleebles
    - Gleebles will try to abduct pibble in their flying saucer
    - UFO's will randomly spawn from either the left or right of the screen and then stop at the center of the screen to send down a tractor beam
    - The tractor beam will then slowly lift pibble off of the ground
    -  click them away before their tractor beam sends pibble away forever
    -  he will fall down with a parachute safely.
> Gleebles are another internet alien pet thing.

#### Research

I will be learning how to accept mouse inputs with python and managing several objects at once
I will learn how to Import images into python to be used as sprites I remember seeing sprites in pygame docs

##### Outcomes

**Ideal Outcome**
  - My ideal outcome is a fun little pet management game like a tamagotchi with animations, sound effects, cute and responsive UI, actually feels fun
  - My girlfriend loves Pibble if I could make this fun it is specifically for my significant partner

**Minimum Outcome**
  - If I can place pibble on the screen saying "wash my belly" which then prompts mouse movement to wash mud off
  - Then pibble says "clean my belly" which then prompts the mouse to grab a sponge and clean suds of soap off of pibble
  - Happy Ending where pibble goes "YAAAAY"

###### Milestones
week 1
1. Place a good looking pibble character on a screen with a background which can then get added functionality
2. Add status bars which slowly tick down and can then be restored when giving pibble food, bath, sleep
week 2
4. Add a randomly spawning ufo that grabs the pibble sprite and can cause a game over screen
5. Create an inventory where berries and pibble supplies can be stored for use on pibble
week 3   
7. Win screen for a happy pibble
8. Sound effects and small ui changes like highlights on items when the mouse cursor is over them.
