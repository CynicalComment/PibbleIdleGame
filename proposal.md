# Pibble Survival
## Survival Game with a dog (Pibble) trying to be full of joy and whimsy
> Pibble is a cute internet term for chubby baby dogs
> particularly baby french bull dogs

In order for pibble to be full of joy and whimsy they must be:
+ clean
  - Wash pibbles belly as it slowly becomes dirtier from the outdoors, the dirtier pibble is the slower joy fills up and eventually it slowly detracts from joy
* full of food
    - Pibble must be kept fed by picking berries from bushes nearby and dragging them from an inventory
+ well rested
  - Pibble needs to take comfy naps if they are cold place a blanket! if it is raining bring them shelter (doghouse)
+ safe from gleebles
    - Gleebles will try to abduct pibble in their flying saucer
    -  click them away before their tractor beam sends pibble away forever
    -  he will fall down with a parachute safely.
> Gleebles are another internet alien pet thing.
