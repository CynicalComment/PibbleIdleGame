#Pibble Survival
Survival Game with a dog (Pibble) managing their sanitation, hunger, sleep, and joy the goal is to make a happy pibble with max joy and reach an end screen
Wash pibbles belly as it slowly becomes dirtier from the outdoors, the dirtier pibble is the slower joy fills up and eventually it slowly detracts from joy
Pibble must be kept fed by picking berries from bushes nearby and dragging them from an inventory
Pibble will go to sleep at times and you have to protect them from other animals and the environment! if it is cold place a blanket on a sleeping pibble or if it is raining drag a dog house over pibble
